<b>Minoru hodo koube o tareru inaho kana</b> 
<br>
The mature rice plant bows its head
<br><br>
We've all seen people think that they're so great or act like they're “all that.” There are the teenagers that think they know it all and are invincible and the people that brag about how rich or successful they are and treat others as if they are dirt. Meanwhile, there are truly great people in the world (think Ghandi, Mother Theresa, or the Dalai Lama) who are very humble and unassuming and quietly go about their business.
<br><br>
Minoru hodo koube o tareru inaho kana is actually a haiku. It literally means, “The more they ripen; the more they bow their heads; the ears of rice.” In other words, “the mature rice plant bows its head.” Basically, this means that with age comes wisdom and humility. The more wisdom, knowledge, skill, success, or power one attains, the more humble one should be. The more you know, the more you know you don't know. The bigger a person you are, the more you should realize that you are like everyone else and that everyone is worthy of respect.  
<br><br>
This expression can be used to remind someone who is getting a little too full of himself to remember the rice plant. You can tell him, “Minoru hodo koube o tareru inaho kana desu yo.” Just be careful who you say this to, as it may come off as a bit preachy. Your boss may not appreciate you saying this to him. If you are tempted to do this, just remind yourself, Minoru hodo koube o tareru inaho kana desu ne..
<br><br>
Usage note: Most Japanese sayings can be turned into complete sentences just by adding “desu” to the end. To add emphasis, add “desu yo”. To ask for agreements (think, “yeah,” “right,” “you know”), add “desu ne”.
