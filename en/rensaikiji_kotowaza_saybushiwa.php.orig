<b>Bushi wa aimitagai</b> 
<br>
Samurai help each other out
<br><br>
Sometimes we become so wrapped up in our own problems that we forget that other people also have problems. We may think, “I have my own problems. Why should I help someone else?” We may also think, “Why do these things only happen to me?” forgetting that other people may be going through the same problems. Sometimes, when we are having troubles, we are too proud to seek or accept help from others. A common sentiment here in America is, “I don't take charity!” However, we do not live in this world by ourselves. Humans have survived as a species because we have learned to cooperate with each other and help each other out. It is human nature.
<br><br>
The Japanese saying, bushi wa aimitagai means that bushi, or samurai warriors, help each other out. This refers to the camaraderie of soldiers on the battlefield. They are in the same desperate position and they must help each other if they are to survive. However, this idea can be extended to all people. We are all in the same situation of living our lives here on earth. We all face similar hardships. Therefore we should all help each other to survive. This saying emphasizes the idea of equals helping equals rather than a superior person giving charity to an inferior person. Especially if we have been in the same situation as someone who is having problems, we know what they are going through and are better able to help them. A cancer survivor can help other cancer patients get through their ordeal. Fellow students can help each other get through their exams. Co-workers can help each other face challenges at work.
<br><br>
You can use this saying if you offer to help someone and they are too reserved or too proud to accept your help. Or if you feel you are imposing too much if someone offers to help you remember, bushi wa aimitagai desu ne.
<br><br>
Usage note: Most Japanese sayings can be turned into complete sentences just by adding “desu” to the end. To add emphasis, add “desu yo”. To ask for agreements (think, “yeah,” “right,” “you know”), add “desu ne”.
