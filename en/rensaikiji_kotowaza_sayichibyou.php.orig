<br>
<b>Ichibyou sokusai</b> 
<br>
One illness, good health
<br><br>
It's easy to feel sorry for yourself when you are ill. You feel like your body has betrayed you. You remember the “good old days” when you were healthy. You envy all the “healthy” people around you, certain that they will live longer and happier lives than you will. However, there is a Japanese proverb that suggests that the opposite may be true.
<br><br>
Ichibyou sokusai literally means, “One illness, good health.” This means that once you have experienced one serious illness, you will live longer than someone who has not. This is because you will be more careful and take better care of yourself than someone who is healthy and takes his health for granted. The “healthy” person may take needless risks, eat unhealthy food, and neglect his body. Someone who has been ill, on the other hand, will tend to be more careful, watch what he eats, and exercise. Thus, the person who was ill may actually live longer than the person who has no serious illnesses during his lifetime. 
<br><br>
You can use this phrase to cheer up someone who is ill, especially if he is losing his will to live. You can also use this to inspire someone who was ill to take better care of themselves and prove the truth of this saying. There are many stories of people who, after a serious illness, go on to lead long and happy lives. Yahari, ichibyou sokusai desu ne. Even if you are healthy, this should be a reminder that you should not take your health for granted. Whether you are healthy or not, take care of yourself and live long and healthy lives!
<br><br>
Usage note: Most Japanese sayings can be turned into complete sentences just by adding “desu” to the end. To add emphasis, add “desu yo”. To ask for agreements (think, “yeah,” “right,” “you know”), add “desu ne”.
