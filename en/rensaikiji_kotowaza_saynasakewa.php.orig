<a href=http://www.nacos.org/en/rensaikiji_kotowaza3.php>Japanese Proverb : 49~72</a> 
</div>
<br>
<b>Nasake wa hito no tame narazu</b> 
<br>
Compassion is not for the benefit of others
<br><br>
We naturally assume that we show kindness and compassion toward others for the benefit of those others. However, there is a wealth of evidence and experience that indicate that the opposite might be true. Indeed, there is a Japanese proverb that suggests this very idea.
<br><br>
Nasake wa hito no tame narazu literally means, “Compassion is not for the benefit of others.” This means that being kind and compassionate to others is actually good for ourselves. William John Bennett, the author of several books on virtue, is quoted as saying, “A kind and compassionate act is often its own reward.” The Dalai Lama has said, “If you want others to be happy, practice compassion. If you want to be happy, practice compassion.” We seem to be programmed such that we achieve the greatest degree of happiness, inner peace, and self-fulfillment when we are caring about and helping others. Some might argue, then, that we help others for selfish reasons. Whatever the case, if helping and caring about others is good for the giver as well as the receiver, it seems like a win-win situation so we might as well just do it.
<br><br>
You can use this phrase to encourage people to be kind to others. If someone is reluctant or resentful about helping someone in need, you can tell them, “Nasake wa hito no tame nararzu desu ne.” Hopefully, they will take your advice, feel good about what they did, and broaden their outlook toward life and other people. And, in so doing, you are doing them a kindness and will reap the benefits of your act.
<br><br>
Usage note: Most Japanese sayings can be turned into complete sentences just by adding “desu” to the end. To add emphasis, add “desu yo”. To ask for agreements (think, “yeah,” “right,” “you know”), add “desu ne”.
